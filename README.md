# CARDIAC-DISEASE-DETECTION-USING-NEURAL-NETWORK-AND-ANFIS-GA

This project is to develop Neural Network and ANFIS-GA-based classification model to predict the risk of heart problems in individuals, leveraging relevant health data. Besides, this project are to design and train Neural Network and ANFIS-GA to discern intricate patterns and nonlinear associations, thereby enhancing the model's ability to predict the likelihood of heart problems.
